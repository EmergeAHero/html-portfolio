    <h1>Nick F</h1>
    <p><em> Founder of <strong> <a href="https://emergeahero.carrd.co/#">Emerge A Hero</a> </strong></em></p>
    <p>I believe that every individual possesses untapped potential, waiting to be discovered and harnessed for a life of fulfillment and success. I never had a hero growing up but through my personal trials, I realized that despite not having one, we can become that hero.
        Over the years I've transformed my life to the point that someone called me their hero. The feeling was like no other. It made me feel deep gratitude for those that inspired me to act. That day I decided to set out on the mission to help others feel what I felt and achieve what I've achieved this far and more.
    
        <p>
        I created Emerge a Hero because, like me, I want you to Emerge a Hero. I believe in your potential and I know I can help you achieve it.
        Join me in unlocking the hero within!</p>
